## 

We want to have 3 type of data tests.

1. Quasi sorted
2. Random
3. Quasi Inverted Sorted

To define quasi, we take:
target_inversion = alpha*n(n-1)/2


Fully sorted = 0 inversion
Where an inversion is i < j and A[i] > A[j].

So swap to get inversion.

Quasi Inverted Sorted is the same but in the other way around.


Parallelisable Sort

MergeSort
QuickSort
RadixSort
